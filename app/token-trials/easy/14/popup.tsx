          Caribbean nations, such as the Bahamas and Jamaica, are actively exploring the use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. For instance, the Bahamas introduced the "Sand Dollar," a state-backed digital currency that allows for faster, more secure transactions. However, these countries are also implementing strict regulatory frameworks to combat financial crimes, like money laundering and fraud. They emphasize compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations to ensure that cryptocurrency can be safely integrated into their economies.
