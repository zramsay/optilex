      <h3>c. Information from Blockchain Interactions</h3>
      <p>Since our services use blockchain technology, any blockchain transactions you engage in are stored on a public ledger and may be viewed by anyone. We may also collect data from these transactions, such as your wallet address and transaction details.</p>

      <h3>b. For Legal Reasons</h3>
      <p>We may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights, or prevent fraud and security issues. Additionally, any data stored on the blockchain cannot be deleted or altered due to the nature of blockchain technology.</p>

      <p>We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services, fulfill legal requirements, or protect our rights. Once data is no longer necessary, we will securely delete or anonymize it, except for information stored on public blockchains.</p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>We take the security of your personal data seriously and implement reasonable safeguards to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, particularly when dealing with blockchain transactions, which are publicly viewable.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
